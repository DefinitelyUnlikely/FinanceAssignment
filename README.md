# Personal Finance Application

## Expectations on the app

For this assignment, the goal was to produce an application that could keep track of transactions for any given user, with the ability to sort/group these transactions based on year, month, week or day they had been done. 
An account system was to be added, so that several users could use the application without accessing each others transaction data. 

Stated goals from the instructor was:
- an app that connects to a database (PostgreSQL) and stores neccessery data in that database. Explicitly told NOT to use any ORM, like EntityFramework.
- a user/account system. Implementing proper hashing of passwords were not a requirement, but recommended.
- The ability to add/remove transactions to the account you're currently logged in as.
- See ones current balance and be able to group transactions by year, month, week or day - and also see the balance for the given grouping. (i.e. if grouped by year, see the balance for 2025, 2024, 2023 etc).
